# radashi-helper

This package is not typically installed directly.

You probably want to clone the [Radashi template](https://github.com/radashi-org/radashi-template) instead.

## Usage

After installing this from NPM, you can use the `radashi help` command to get started.

```
pnpm radashi help
```

Alternatively, there's a guide over at the [Radashi website](https://radashi-org.github.io/your-own-radashi).
